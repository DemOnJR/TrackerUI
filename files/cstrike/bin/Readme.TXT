If you see this file, that mean TrackerUI is installed on your Counter-Strike, TrackerUI is a DynamicLinkLibrary made by CSME.GA developing team this file is rewriting 3rd party unneeded file
like "GameUI.DLL, Vendora.DLL, CTSHiled.DLL, SteamID.dll"... and more file, you can read more about "TrackerUI.DLL" in our official website "http://csme.ga/".

TrackerUI save you from a serious vulnerability in your Counter-Strike client.
Your client doesn't filter file types downloaded from server also, your client doesn't filter commands sent from server to be executed in the console, which can also be used to cause damage,
so after downloading "TrackerUI.DLL" we will automaticly patch your Counter-Strike to stop the 3rd party file which can be used to make serious damage to your computer and data.

If "TrackerUI" caused any disfunctionality of your Counter-Strike client we're sorry for the inconvenience.
Original files are saved by adding '.orig' to file name before making any changes, therefore any disfunctionality can be fixed.
